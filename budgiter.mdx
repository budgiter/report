## How has Budgiter progressed?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Spreadsheet Template">
    Budgiter started as a personal budgeting spreadsheet adapted to a shareable template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Minimal Viable Demo">
    Different technologies were leveraged to build a working demo of a minimal viable product but lacked backend capabilities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Minimal Viable Product">
    New technologies allowed for a legitimate minimal viable product but lacked basic security features wherein all budgets were, in a sense, public.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alpha / Beta">
    Budgiter was completely rebuilt with different technologies from a personal passion around security and privacy that did not allow for the previous product to exist without a complete and thorough revamp.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Most of the <Tooltip tip="minimal viable product features">core features</Tooltip> planned for Budgiter are live and available now. 

## Why was Budgiter created?

After trying many different budgeting tools from a personal need to understand and manage my spending I ultimately created what I was looking for in a spreadsheet. However, this spreadsheet had many quality of life issues that made it very tedious to keep up with. Acknowledging these faults in existing budgeting options led me to build what ultimately works for me. 

## When is Budgiter launching?

Budgiter is leveraging a lot of technologies that were not originally planned for out of necessity. While Budgiter exists using technologies out of necessity and not out of ability or capacity then it will remain in a dark launch. 

<Note>Budgiter is in early development</Note>
